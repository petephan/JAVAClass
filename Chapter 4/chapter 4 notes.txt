HW chapter 4:
practice while/if
need to only use main, 1 class
3 employees:
4.20: do it for one time... then add loop logic to it
loop 3 times
{get user input hours
get user input rate
calculate
print}

overtime. 45 hours, 5 hours will be 1.5x pay

output:
enter hourly rate: 20
enter hours worked: 30
pay for employee 1 is $600

enter hourly rate:20
enter hours worked: 50
pay for employee 2 is $1100

employee 3

grand total to pay out (total = total +....)

4.21: mix it up... put the biggest one is at the first & last while testing
to find the largest number, compare first 2 values to find larger, then go on
store value if larger than the previous
compare largest with number
action: if number is bigger, replace largest with number

4.22:
table.java

output
N  10*N  100*N  1000*N
1   10   100    1000
2  20    200 2000
...
5  50  500 5000

use 1 print f only
