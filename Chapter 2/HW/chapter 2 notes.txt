Slide 6: Comments on program
//Exercise number
//Purpose of program
//Name / Date
later in code: comment on big blocks of code (like 1/3 page - half a page)

public static void main( String[] args )
-wait to explain this in chp 7
-view as starting point to run a program

public - can be called by other programs
static - 
void - no return
main - name of the method
String [] args - parameter
String - type
String [] - array of strings
args - name of parameter

line 9 is the only thing that does anything (that is unique)
System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
-called a statement


Class:
{variables
	
	....main
	{
	}

	method1
	{
	}

	method2
	{
	}
}

method is the word for function in Java

Slide 14: Class names start with capital letter and capitalize the first letter of each word

identifier is another word for "name of something"

Test1 - good identifier name, good class name
test12 - good identifier, bad class name
2class - bad identifier, bad class name
$x - good identifier, bad class name
_y - good identifier, bad class name
Helloclass - good identifier, valid, but bad class name


Slide 32: Class and file name have to be the same name

Slide 35: print doesnt add a line break. println does

Slide 37: \n is an escape character - line break

Slide 38: 

Slide 41: printf - formatted printing
"%s \n$s \n" - pattern printing
%s = string
advantage of doing this is that it is not fixed. Variable is used as placeholder. You can change it on the fly in the future without changing everything

Slide 44:
Purpose is to take 2 numbers and add them. Display total
input.nextInt(); - saying to monitor the System.in (system input)

input = the object

Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
Scanner - existing class from java.util.Scanner;

input can be any name

%d - integer type
%f - double type (decimals)

Slide 64: 
10%3 = 1 (remainder)
1%3 = 1
1/3 = 0. Quotient is 0
to get decimal, u can do 1/2.0

Slide 70:

Slide 72:

Slide 73: 

HW:
output is "1 2 3 4"

call the project "Print"
for the third one use %d

2nd problem is 2.16
use one of the slide 70, 72, 73
make sure result says "%d is larger", etc

use 1 output file is fine for all files
